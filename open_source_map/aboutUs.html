                    Open Source Masterplan is a website that not only does the looking for you, but also the pricing and all round background check. We at OS Masterplan are devoted to helping you find ur dream land, within your price range, in your choice location, and that's
                    not all, we show you diverse variants to choose from. OS Masterplan is a simple to use website, and since it's just upcoming, we are primarily focused on just one locality to branch out . OS Masterplan is your go to site, and it's
                    simple to use. <br> The Master plan of some of the communities in and around us is not made available to the public as a result of bottlenecks from the various regulatory Agencies, this project aims to solve this
                    problem by open sourcing it. This master plan will aid each user to not only build houses, businesses or companies in compliance to our master plan, but it also prevents clients from obtaining government owned properties. The problems
                    that come with that is one which we don't let our clients experience. From anywhere in the state, clients can view the properties based on accessibility to places of interest or routes. It also not only shows them the layout but also
                    systems that affect living. The aim of this is to give each client/user the access to the pre-design Masterplan of the state
